The reason I believe it's related to the software is because when I open the program and try to navigate, the progress bar usually starts spinning after a minute or so, but eventually reaches the end. However, if I Close the software without navigating first, and then reopen it, the progress bar will start from the beginning and usually reach the end about half way through the navigation.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">If you are experiencing the progress bar spinning or jumpy behaviour, it may be due to how your computer is configured. Normally, when a program initializes (such as Guidare Boat Navigation), it will check to see if your screen also needs to be initialized. This can cause a delay in starting up the navigation software if your display is busy refreshing (like when you first start your computer up in the morning). Try exiting Guidare Boat Navigation and opening it again without first navigating; this should hopefully avoid any delays and fix the issue.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the map is not being displayed</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">intermittent trouble loading tap to zoom for map on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite<BR>Status: This problem has been ongoing and does not seem to be resolving.<BR>Issue: As I try to open the map for navigation, there is an intermittent trouble loading tap to zoom feature.

First, it may be that there is an error with the navigation data tiles or map elements loading. If you are having trouble downloading certain map tiles or elements, try restarting your computer or refreshing your browser cache. If that does not help, please send us an email and we'd be happy to look into it further.<BR><BR>Another possible cause of this problem could be interference from other wireless devices in your area. Some navigation systems use wireless technology to manage maps and navaids, so check to see if there are any other devices broadcasting near your computer or navigation system. Try temporarily disabling any wireless networks or individual devices in your area until the issue resolves itself.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>there is no connection to the sensors</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">There is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software.

The software suite used to control the nav system suffers from intermittent errors that trigger when the maps are changed. Once the maps are changed, the software pulls down the other applications that rely on the guidance data, leading to lost position and navigation. Changing the maps forces Mercury's guidance system to restart, exacerbating the problem.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">A possible solution to this problem could involve integrating a piloting system into the nav system. This piloting system could take the place of the software suite used to control the nav system, and would be responsible for taking the user's current position and navigating them to their desired destination. In cases where the map changes cause navigation problems, the piloting system would help to smoothly resettle Mercury's position, minimizing regression caused by map changes.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>mapping a new route</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have a 1993 Mercury Mountaineer and recently replaced the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application with a new one.

Does anyone know how to fix this?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a number of reasons why your Mercury navigation software is shutting down when connected to a wifi network. Many times the culprit is an active ad blocking program or browser extension that is slowing down the network connection and causing programs licenced through Mercury such as Guidare Boat Navigation Suite to crash. Another potential culprit could be DNS caching (a feature used by networks to speed up connections by resolving IP addresses into directional Gateway and Nameserver PFN lookups).

This will clear out any temporary files that may be causing the problem and help start your machine fresh.<BR><BR>2. Restore your original GBNS installation from a backup file. If you do not have a backup, contact your dealer.<BR><BR>3. Disable autopilot in GBNS and re-enable it.

Unrelated software may have been installed on the same machine at the same time, and this issue can happen when those programs conflict with or override GBNS' settings. The most common scenario for this occurs when you install GBNS updates while your old installation is still installed. Check to see if updates are being installed and uninstall any unrelated software if necessary. Re-install GBNS from a backup if you do not have one, and disable autopilot in GBNS if it is currently enabled and try again. Reload GBNS if prompted.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, when I enable the Fishfinder option in the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application, I randomly experience freezing of the application.

I recommend you try these techniques to troubleshoot the issue: <BR><BR>1. Make sure that your computer is up-to-date and that all updates are installed.<BR><BR>2. For Office software, check if Publisher or Access is open and if there are any protected files in Silo accessed by either application. Close any other programs on your computer before trying to connect to Sonar. If Publisher or Access are not open and no protected files are found, then forwarding port 443 (HTTPS) to your computer may help. To forward a port:  In Windows 7 or Vista – Open UASetup .exe . Select the CA - PC Endpoint server and click Properties . In the Action button list, temporarily click Forward ports . In the pop-up window, type 445 and Service name–Localhost , and then click OK . Point your browser to http://localhost:445 (or whatever your specified port number will be). <BR><BR>3. Try connecting from a different computer if possible. If connecting from another computer does not work, try using an alternate internet connection such as a hotel or airport network that is faster than your home internet connection.<BR><BR>4. If you have an antivirus software installed on your computer, uninstall it and re-install itwihtout any add-on programs such as broadband security or antivirus filtering tools</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the real time tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury OnMyWay Version 7.2.3 TomTom Application and Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite is resetting inconsistently when trying to use the "Enable the real time tracker" feature which was added in a recent software update.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hello!<BR><BR>We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with your Mercury OnMyWay TomTom Application and Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.

Can you help me fix this?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">When you get a message like this, it usually means that the onboard computer has detected an issue with your sonar system and is automatically seeking guidance from a nearby boat or vessel to correct the problem. There are a few things you can do to try and fix the problem on your own:<BR><BR>1 Try disconnecting your sonar system completely and then reconnecting it. This should force the onboard computer to detects if there has been any significant change in contact with your sonar unit and initialize the application successfully. <BR><BR>2 Clear your USB drive of all existing data, including the installation files for the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application. If your USB drive is quickmount enabled, try unplugging and then plugging it back in again to reset its connection. This could also Refresh your PC's drivers so that they are up-to-date. <BR><BR>3 Make sure there is enough power being sent to your sonar unit. Verify that the power outlet where your sonar is plugged into is properly configured, as well as checking that the wire leading from your trolling motor is securely welded to multi-cam railings or another secure location on the boat. If you have extension cords running to various devices on your boat, make sure they're grounded against an unpainted metal surface before plugging them into an outlet (this includes emergency chargers). <BR><BR>4 Rundiagnostictool.com can be used to determine if there is any booting issues with your PC or installation of software.

All of the other cars I have had, including my 2010 Nissan Maxima, never booted that application and didn't require me to enable it. However, the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application always boots when I turn on my Mercury (even when I'm not using the car navigation system). Is there a way to disable this application so that it doesn't boot every time I turn on the car?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There is no easy solution to this problem, as it would require disabling the software suite application in question. If you only want it to load when you are actually using the car navigation system, you could try installing the application to a separate drive, or preferably, removable media (such as a flash drive).</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to the internal wifi</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, the connecting to the internal wifi is done by the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

Make sure your device has enough Battery life - this isn't always easy to measure, but if your Maps are taking longer than usual to start up or sufficient time elapses before anerror message pops-up, suggestions for boosting battery life may be required (see our article here).</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>mapping a new route</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, check to make sure the route you are trying to map is actually reachable. Sometimes smaller islands can be missed when navigation is done using a predetermined route. If the destination isn't within range, there may not be an approved method of navigation available to you.   Next, check to make sure that your device can actually reach the destination you are trying to reach. Different areas have different equipment requirements, so it is important to verify everything before beginning. Finally, map using the most up-to-date maps and charts available.

I have tried pressing the reset button on my router and re-installing the GNS application, but neither of these attempts have worked. Could you advise as to what I can do to fix this issue?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, it’s possible that your system is configured to use a wireless network that isn't supported by the GNS software. Check the version number of the software and make sure that your system or firmware is up to date. If you don’t have any wireless networks available in your area, you may need to buy a USB wireless adapter for your system. In addition, it's possible that you're not properly activating the wireless adapter on your system. Double-check to see if your system is broadcasting its name and SSID (network name) loudly and distinctly from each of the ESS points travelled through during setup. Finally, if you're connecting from inside a building, it's possible that there are nearby metal objects causing interference. Try installing a shield around your computer so metal objects are blocked from your signal.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>viewing the BlueChart maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When i try to open the BlueChart map on my Windows 8.1 laptop, it is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Error 40.

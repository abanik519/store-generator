The reason I believe it's related to the software is because when I open the program and try to navigate, the progress bar usually starts spinning after a minute or so, but eventually reaches the end. However, if I Close the software without navigating first, and then reopen it, the progress bar will start from the beginning and usually reach the end about half way through the navigation.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">If you are experiencing the progress bar spinning or jumpy behaviour, it may be due to how your computer is configured. Normally, when a program initializes (such as Guidare Boat Navigation), it will check to see if your screen also needs to be initialized. This can cause a delay in starting up the navigation software if your display is busy refreshing (like when you first start your computer up in the morning). Try exiting Guidare Boat Navigation and opening it again without first navigating; this should hopefully avoid any delays and fix the issue.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the map is not being displayed</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">intermittent trouble loading tap to zoom for map on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite<BR>Status: This problem has been ongoing and does not seem to be resolving.<BR>Issue: As I try to open the map for navigation, there is an intermittent trouble loading tap to zoom feature.

First, it may be that there is an error with the navigation data tiles or map elements loading. If you are having trouble downloading certain map tiles or elements, try restarting your computer or refreshing your browser cache. If that does not help, please send us an email and we'd be happy to look into it further.<BR><BR>Another possible cause of this problem could be interference from other wireless devices in your area. Some navigation systems use wireless technology to manage maps and navaids, so check to see if there are any other devices broadcasting near your computer or navigation system. Try temporarily disabling any wireless networks or individual devices in your area until the issue resolves itself.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>there is no connection to the sensors</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for there is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">There is no connection to the sensors on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software.

The software suite used to control the nav system suffers from intermittent errors that trigger when the maps are changed. Once the maps are changed, the software pulls down the other applications that rely on the guidance data, leading to lost position and navigation. Changing the maps forces Mercury's guidance system to restart, exacerbating the problem.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">A possible solution to this problem could involve integrating a piloting system into the nav system. This piloting system could take the place of the software suite used to control the nav system, and would be responsible for taking the user's current position and navigating them to their desired destination. In cases where the map changes cause navigation problems, the piloting system would help to smoothly resettle Mercury's position, minimizing regression caused by map changes.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>mapping a new route</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: mapping a new route is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have a 1993 Mercury Mountaineer and recently replaced the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application with a new one.

Does anyone know how to fix this?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a number of reasons why your Mercury navigation software is shutting down when connected to a wifi network. Many times the culprit is an active ad blocking program or browser extension that is slowing down the network connection and causing programs licenced through Mercury such as Guidare Boat Navigation Suite to crash. Another potential culprit could be DNS caching (a feature used by networks to speed up connections by resolving IP addresses into directional Gateway and Nameserver PFN lookups).

This will clear out any temporary files that may be causing the problem and help start your machine fresh.<BR><BR>2. Restore your original GBNS installation from a backup file. If you do not have a backup, contact your dealer.<BR><BR>3. Disable autopilot in GBNS and re-enable it.

Unrelated software may have been installed on the same machine at the same time, and this issue can happen when those programs conflict with or override GBNS' settings. The most common scenario for this occurs when you install GBNS updates while your old installation is still installed. Check to see if updates are being installed and uninstall any unrelated software if necessary. Re-install GBNS from a backup if you do not have one, and disable autopilot in GBNS if it is currently enabled and try again. Reload GBNS if prompted.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, when I enable the Fishfinder option in the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application, I randomly experience freezing of the application.

I recommend you try these techniques to troubleshoot the issue: <BR><BR>1. Make sure that your computer is up-to-date and that all updates are installed.<BR><BR>2. For Office software, check if Publisher or Access is open and if there are any protected files in Silo accessed by either application. Close any other programs on your computer before trying to connect to Sonar. If Publisher or Access are not open and no protected files are found, then forwarding port 443 (HTTPS) to your computer may help. To forward a port:  In Windows 7 or Vista – Open UASetup .exe . Select the CA - PC Endpoint server and click Properties . In the Action button list, temporarily click Forward ports . In the pop-up window, type 445 and Service name–Localhost , and then click OK . Point your browser to http://localhost:445 (or whatever your specified port number will be). <BR><BR>3. Try connecting from a different computer if possible. If connecting from another computer does not work, try using an alternate internet connection such as a hotel or airport network that is faster than your home internet connection.<BR><BR>4. If you have an antivirus software installed on your computer, uninstall it and re-install itwihtout any add-on programs such as broadband security or antivirus filtering tools</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the real time tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury OnMyWay Version 7.2.3 TomTom Application and Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite is resetting inconsistently when trying to use the "Enable the real time tracker" feature which was added in a recent software update.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hello!<BR><BR>We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with your Mercury OnMyWay TomTom Application and Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.

Can you help me fix this?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">When you get a message like this, it usually means that the onboard computer has detected an issue with your sonar system and is automatically seeking guidance from a nearby boat or vessel to correct the problem. There are a few things you can do to try and fix the problem on your own:<BR><BR>1 Try disconnecting your sonar system completely and then reconnecting it. This should force the onboard computer to detects if there has been any significant change in contact with your sonar unit and initialize the application successfully. <BR><BR>2 Clear your USB drive of all existing data, including the installation files for the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application. If your USB drive is quickmount enabled, try unplugging and then plugging it back in again to reset its connection. This could also Refresh your PC's drivers so that they are up-to-date. <BR><BR>3 Make sure there is enough power being sent to your sonar unit. Verify that the power outlet where your sonar is plugged into is properly configured, as well as checking that the wire leading from your trolling motor is securely welded to multi-cam railings or another secure location on the boat. If you have extension cords running to various devices on your boat, make sure they're grounded against an unpainted metal surface before plugging them into an outlet (this includes emergency chargers). <BR><BR>4 Rundiagnostictool.com can be used to determine if there is any booting issues with your PC or installation of software.

All of the other cars I have had, including my 2010 Nissan Maxima, never booted that application and didn't require me to enable it. However, the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application always boots when I turn on my Mercury (even when I'm not using the car navigation system). Is there a way to disable this application so that it doesn't boot every time I turn on the car?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There is no easy solution to this problem, as it would require disabling the software suite application in question. If you only want it to load when you are actually using the car navigation system, you could try installing the application to a separate drive, or preferably, removable media (such as a flash drive).</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to the internal wifi</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, the connecting to the internal wifi is done by the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

Make sure your device has enough Battery life - this isn't always easy to measure, but if your Maps are taking longer than usual to start up or sufficient time elapses before anerror message pops-up, suggestions for boosting battery life may be required (see our article here).</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>mapping a new route</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Mapping a new route is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, check to make sure the route you are trying to map is actually reachable. Sometimes smaller islands can be missed when navigation is done using a predetermined route. If the destination isn't within range, there may not be an approved method of navigation available to you.   Next, check to make sure that your device can actually reach the destination you are trying to reach. Different areas have different equipment requirements, so it is important to verify everything before beginning. Finally, map using the most up-to-date maps and charts available.

I have tried pressing the reset button on my router and re-installing the GNS application, but neither of these attempts have worked. Could you advise as to what I can do to fix this issue?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, it’s possible that your system is configured to use a wireless network that isn't supported by the GNS software. Check the version number of the software and make sure that your system or firmware is up to date. If you don’t have any wireless networks available in your area, you may need to buy a USB wireless adapter for your system. In addition, it's possible that you're not properly activating the wireless adapter on your system. Double-check to see if your system is broadcasting its name and SSID (network name) loudly and distinctly from each of the ESS points travelled through during setup. Finally, if you're connecting from inside a building, it's possible that there are nearby metal objects causing interference. Try installing a shield around your computer so metal objects are blocked from your signal.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>viewing the BlueChart maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: viewing the BlueChart maps is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When i try to open the BlueChart map on my Windows 8.1 laptop, it is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Error 40.

First, it's possible that the connection between the software and sensors is successful, but not reliable - in this case, you would receive alerts for hazards as you approach, but the actual position tracking would be intermittently inaccurate. Second, it's possible that the sensors are not compatible with Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite. Third, it's possible that the relevant settings on your devices are incorrect - please consult the manufacturer's documentation for more information on proper sensor installation and configuration. Finally, it's possible that you may need a new sensor - in which case, please contact the sensor manufacturer for more information on compatibility.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>cannot connect to Panoptix device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].

I've read online that this issue is generally caused by low or insufficient system memory, but no one has been able to provide a solution. I'm using Windows 7 Professional 64-bit PC.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">I've struggled with this very issue and have found a few minimal solutions.<BR><BR>1. Make a system recovery disk or a clone of your hard drive to restore your system if it fails in the middle of your journey.<BR>2. Disconnect allexternal devices and peripherals, including the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application, and see if that resolves the issue. Close all unnecessary programs and processes before connecting external devices.<BR>3. Verify that you are using the correct drivers for your Mercury OS and hardware device. I'm using Compaq Mercury 6100 laptops with integrated Nvidia graphics, so I downloaded the newest drivers from Nvidia's website for my specific laptop. Updating drivers on a regular basis can resolved intermittently low system memory as well as other more serious hardware issues. <BR>4.. Check to see if there is spyware, malware or adware installed on your computer that may be consuming resources or slowing down your Mercury OS. Remove any suspicious items from your computer and run a diagnostics scan with an appropriate scanner such as Microsoft's Toolkit Offline (offline scan) or Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware Free.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the wind capture function</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.

One option would be to disable the fishfinder automatically when the Villager enters Active Cruising Mode. You could also temporarily disable your fishfinder by pressing the "Fishing Mode" button multiple times until the indicator blinks slowly (it will eventually shut off).

After doing a little detective work and testing ways to reproduce the problem, it's possible that there is interference corrupting the communications between your computer and the certified security adapter. A dead parabolic antenna on top of your satellite dish could also be causing a similar issue. Consider unplugging your satellite dish and replacing it with a wired connection in order to rule out those possible causes. If that doesn't solve the issue, it might be time to contact your cable provider and ask them to check for any potential interference before you connect your computer to the network.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>viewing the BlueChart maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.

It is possible that you are missing the required software or hardware components, or that you are experiencing some space-related compatibility issues. If you have already attempted to activate your ID but failed, it may be helpful to troubleshoot your configuration by performing a raw file transfer from another machine without the benefit of Quest's application or customization tools. Once you have determined the source of the problem, please contact Quest Support for further assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>changing the maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

You can find this information on Mercury's website (www.mercury based.com), or by selecting "about Customer Services" when starting the car. The newest versions of maps should be available soon after they are released. <BR><BR>-Make sure that you are using the most recent softwareupdate for your car. You can do this by going to Menu - System Setup - Onboard Computer Updates. If you go Custom Maps, be sure to check "Update Automatically". <BR><BR>-If you experience map freezing, try quitting the Guided Tour computer program and restarting it. For best results, use a direct link from your desktop to the Mercury website when starting up Guided Tour: Go to www.mercurybased.com/gboussea select Guided Tour and click Open in New Window.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>mapping a new route</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

As a result, the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application malfunctions and becomes almost unresponsive. The repairs required to prevent future problems seem overwhelming and require invasive procedures that could undo years of hard work.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The most common problems people experience with their electronic gear are freezing and general software issues. Symptoms can range from simply not being able to start the navigation software suite or changing vessel setting to outright system shutdowns or corruptions. Depending on the severity of the problem and the age of your electronics, fixing it might involve anything from addressing specific causes connected to freezing such as improper insulation levels or corrosion, to completely rebuilding and re-issuing critical electronics components. There's no one "right" answer to this situation as every boat is different and will require a tailored approach that considers the age, type and condition of your electronics. If you're experiencing any electrical issues on board, be sure to take quick notes on what occurred including when, where and how it occurred in order to help improve\ prevent future failures. Additionally, if you're considering any maintenance or repairs work done on your boat, do your homework first by speaking with a pro who specializes in fleet electronics\ boat repairs so you know exactly what needs to be done and safest procedures for minimizing potential damage.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

Thanks, Amiya Henson.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have a Mercury Monterey 2004 with Ford SYNC. The BlueChart Maps application resets the Guidare Boat Navigation software suite everytime I open it. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, resetting the computer, clearing all caches and browsers, changing from manual to satellite navigation and back to manual again, resetting my network settings, and even reformatting my hard drive. None of it has worked. What can I do?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The most common reason one might be having difficulty with the BlueChart mapping application is that the map data for their area of the country has since been changed and the application needs to be updated in order to display this properly. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a way around this task. The only solution appears to be for the individual to wait until the software updates are released and install them when they become available.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to sonar</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.

Check the location of your router and possibly adjust the settings if necessary. If that doesn't help, you might need to purchase a new router. There also could be interference from other electronics in your home OR office. Try moving those away from your computer or bringing in an omni- directional antennas if that isn't effective. In addition, if you are using an older or slower laptop with a single network card, it might not be able to keep up with the two or more users on a wifi network and get bogged down trying to connect. Purchase a newer, faster laptop with multiple network cards and/or boost your internet connection speed.<BR><BR>If these measures don't remedy the issue, there could be a problem with the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application itself. Make sure you have installed all of the latest updates for the software (available via downloads on our support site at http://www.guidareboatsolutions.com/support), as well as verifying that the videos and navigational data used in the software are legitimate and licensed for your use. Please also check whether Compatibility Mode (available by clicking "Compatibility Mode" on the left side of each video) is enabled on your computer. Turning Compatibility Mode off should return the application to its default settings and allow consistently connecting to internal wifi networks without resetting.<BR><BR>If these steps fail, it would be worth sending the software to us so that we can run exhaustive scans from our cloud-based scanners for viruses, spyware and other malicious softwareDPsychologist Brent OzburnCEO & Chief Psychologist, North American Society for Human Resource ManagementCTO & Chief Psychologist, BLEST HR Consultants</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>viewing the BlueChart maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.

Sometimes when a car damages an antenna cable, it can cause the transmission to fail. If you follow the instructions for connecting the sonar and still no luck, please consult with a mechanic or an electronics specialist to try and troubleshoot the issue.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the autopilot</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.

Regards, April Casey.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Typically when someone installs the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite, they are expecting it to work and enable the autopilot. However, some users are experiencing problems after installing the software. This problem typically occurs because the installer failed to enable in-application silencing for the autopilot. Without this protection in place, the autopilot will start up periodically (depending on how often it is active) and flood the user's computer with noise. In many cases, fixing this problem requires disabling the autopilot entirely and then reinstalling the navigation software.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Thank you for bringing this potential problem to our attention. We apologize for any inconvenience that may be caused by this issue and are currently looking into a possible solution. In the meantime, if you experience repeated occurrences of the autopilot starting up automatically, we recommend installing the software with in-application silencing enabled so that the noise it produce is not so harmful.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.

The first, and most common is that you may have turned off the Fishfinder function in your boat's navigation system. To enable the Fishfinder, go into the menus on your boating system and select "Function Options." Select "Fishfinder" and make sure that it is switched to "On." If it is not already on, you will likely need to toggle it on before you can use it. <BR>There could also be an issue with your Mercury Marine Fishfinder's software. Go ahead and try activating the Fishfinder again, but this time first make sure that your Mercury Genuine Instrument Warranty (GID) sticker is still in place. If you do not have a GID sticker, then go ahead and contact your local Mercury Dealer or Authorized Service Center for assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to the internal wifi</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.

One possibility is that the Mercury's wifi network address is unknown or has changed since you last connected. You can try to connect to the wifi network using the Mercury's network settings and then contacting nearby mobile networks to see if they have an unobstrusive network near by. In addition, it is possible that the Mercury's Google account has been deactivated or deleted, in which case you will need to reactivate it or create a new one. Finally, sometimes routers incompatible with some wifi networks can cause connectivity issues. In this instance, it might be worth trying a different router before resorting to resetting your Mercury's router.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>viewing the BlueChart maps</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.

Can you help me?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a number of reasons why your Mercury marine outboard will not move. First, it's possible that the battery could be dead. If you've recently replaced the battery, make sure to charge it prior to usage so that it's fully operational. Additionally, ensure that each switch and connector on your outboard is properly seated and connected. Finally, if there is something stuck in the gears, a manual override may be necessary in order to free the obstruction. If none of these solutions work and you are certain that the battery is fully charged and all connections are properly made, then it may be necessary to take your outboard repairman into account for more serious diagnoses.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>i have a blank screen</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite on my Mercury, i have a blank screen.

This problem would greatly frustrate users who are trying to complete a task and must constantly search for the correct location on the screen in order to keep track of their progress.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">One possible solution for this problem could be to add a button that dismisses the progress bar, or allows the user to cancel its appearance altogether. Another solution could be to make it moreclear when the progressbar is going to start spinning and how long it will last.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the map is not being displayed</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for the map is not being displayed on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.

In the item labelled "IP addressing," make sure that the "Subnetmask" box is set to netmask Default (255.255.0.0), and the "Gateway" box is set to the appropriate IP address of your computer ( usually an odd number ).</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>cannot connect other devices</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for cannot connect other devices on my Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite.

First, make sure that your computer is connected to the docked Mercury OutBOARD Sport 50 motorboat securely. If it's not secure, the computer may see the boat as a moveable obstruction and therefore block access to the map screen. Second, check that your installation of the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite is up-to-date. Third, be sure that you are attempting to direct your OutBOARD Sport 50 using the software interface rather than controlling it manually with joystick/Joy Pad. In some cases, newer onboard electronics (such as those in some 2010–present OutBOARD Sports) may limit manual control of boating features to basic functions such as heading, speed, and proximity alarms setting.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>there is no connection to the sensors</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite on my Mercury, there is no connection to the sensors.

When you first install the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite, you have to create and set up your account with their website. After you have created your account, you can then link it to your Mercury. Once you have linked it, make sure that your Mercury is connected to the internet. After you have linked it, open the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite on your Mercury and select Routes from the Menu Bar on the left. If you haven't linked your account yet, than an introductory page will appear which will guide you through the linking process.

It's possible that your computer system is unable to handle the extremely high demand ofaquarium tracking software at the same time. Additionally, fish finders often use complex electronics that are susceptible to cyber-attacks. To protect against these threats, it'simportant to make sure that your antivirus and firewall protection are up-to-date,along with regular system security checks. If those steps don't work, we suggest youcontact Mercury Customer Service for more help.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to the internal wifi</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

Best, Alexis</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The Mercury hanging out of gear problem could be caused by many things, but it is most likely the autopilot becoming disconnected. Sometimes when boats are travelling at a slow speed in the water, minor things like branches or rocks can get caught in between the gears and reel the engine off-line. If this has been happening often and your boat seems to be slipping even further out of gear,may be time for a mechanic to look at your engine and autopilot.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is freezing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

The Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite Application is necessary for this functionality. You should ensure that it is installed and active on your Mercury, and then re-check the "Enable Wind Capture" check box in User Controls after exiting the application. If all goes well, you should then restart your Mercury and test the wind capture functionality.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>activating the vessel identification</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: activating the vessel identification is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

First, I recommend consulting your Owner's Manual or other documentation related to your GPS SYSTEM in order to ascertain how to reset or configure it. In some cases, this may involve plugging in power directly to the instrument using the supplied cord, while in others it may require using the software which comes preloaded on the system. In either event, I recommend trying each of these methods in turn until you lockout or otherwise correct the problem.<BR><BR>If resetting/configuring your GPS system doesn't workaround the issue, then I'll need more information from you in order to properly diagnose and potentially solve it. For instance: what specific software application are you using (i.e., Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite specifically), model and year of your Mercury vehicle, driver's identity (name and license plate number), etc...? Also please let me know if you've tried any alternate paths or routes recently - sometimes minor changes such as this can CAUSE issues on established routes later on.

These points help to orient your current location when viewing charts or navigating. After upgrading to Windows 10, Mercury updated its guidance point software to use a new format that the older Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application did not support. The old software was unable to load the new guidance points, and as a result it may not have been possible to view BlueChart maps on Mercury computers.

One possibility is that the Mercury's GPS satellite receiver might be malfunctioning. If you believe that this might be the case, you can try augmenting your navigation with other means, such as dead reckoning or heading directly to the destination without using any navigational aids. In some cases, a disconnected or faulty satnav connection might also prevent your Mercury from connecting to sonar. If you have tried all of the above and your Mercury still does not seem to be able to connect, you may need to bring the device in for service.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the real time tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the real time tracker is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

Try downloading and running the most recent version of the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application from our website.2) Your computer'sbumper or network ports are not properly configured. Formatting yourhard drive, sealing off air vents, and updatingyour network drivers could all help improvel performance when accessing webpages andservers.3) You may be trying to access the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suiteapplication from an un- securedconnection.

Both applications use the Windows SideShow graphics drivers to render maps on your desktop, so if one is malfunctioning for some reason and is prevent inge computer from doing its usual stuff like starting up services or applications then the other also may not start. In my experience restarting a computer often cures these types of blue-screen errors, but is not always guaranteed.If that doesn't do the trick - or if you’re comfortable taking additional measures - you may opt to uninstall BlueChart entirely and try reinstalling it later; though this is an inconvenient solution and can render your map data unusable.Hope this helps resolve your issue!</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to sonar</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: connecting to sonar is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: connecting to sonar is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: connecting to sonar is shutting down the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I am having issues connecting to the sonar: shutting down the Boat Navigation Suite application.

Basically, when you map a new route, the software is resetting itself to interpret the coordinates as a new starting point. We're sorry to hear that this is causing trouble for you, and we're working on a resolution. Meanwhile, there are a few options that might work better for you:<BR><BR>· Refresh your navigational database - This restores all of the data in your navigational database to its most recent state. This will usually clear up any errors or glitches that might have occurred since the last time you refreshed your database.<BR><BR>· Choose manually workaround coordinates - In some cases, selecting manually safe coordinates can solve an issue with the software being unable to properly recognize new coordinates. This will require you to enter latitude and longitude values which are not initially represented in digital form by your electronic devices' scanner.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting the sonar</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: connecting the sonar is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: connecting the sonar is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: connecting the sonar is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">You are more than likely experiencing a problem with connecting your sonar system to the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

This problem seems to occur randomly, and there is currently no known solution.<BR><BR>When attempting to view a map in the BlueChart navigation application, the application seeminglybehaves as if it has been launched multiple times and each time Zooming in or Panning around causes different layers and graphics within the map window to reset. This results in redo of tasks performed in previous sessions (whether or not local cached data exists), forcing either a reload of the entire application or careful selection of menu commands that avoid triggering the issue. Particularly troublesome are charts with large basemaps loaded, as attempting to move focus away from the chart area repeatedly causes conflicts between loading basemap data while preserving previously zoomed-in orientations, culminating in lost zoom levels and layers as well as shatteredcale graphics.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">In several cases, selecting plotted points or drawing upon map data have also led to fields in a map window resetting to their near-empty defaults.<BR><BR>Although this behavior is intermittent and seems unrelated to other features of the app, it has resulted in variously lost 0.00, survey channel labels; edited item label color/font settings; and incorrect aerial dark green Lambert95 shading across large portions of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Users encountering such issues are generally unable to locate repair procedures or code paths that could restores functionality.

This is usually because the software suite is loading all of its related files. In some cases, this process can be slowed down if your computer is running slow or burdened with multiple applications running at the same time. Reportedly, America's Cup racing illustrates this scenario as vessels move between lanes. Each boat produces a wake which displaces water and other objects, thus affecting the speed and efficiency of everyone else around them. Similarly, if you have a lot of small file bundles firing off rapid instructions at the same time, your system may struggle to keep up. Although there are no easy answers when it comes to performance, common sense guidelines such as reducing needless processes or consolidating smaller files might make a difference.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to sonar</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: connecting to sonar is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: connecting to sonar is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: connecting to sonar is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application (GNSS) is not being able to connect to the desired satellites.

Check for updates for the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite software (eg https://guidare.com/en/support/software-updates). If the source code of the software resides on a remote server, verify that the server security is up to date and hardened against intrusion by reviewing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite SecureSource Guide (https://guidare.com/en/support/guide-securesource). Use specific control procedures in place to avoid possible issues when connecting to mandatory infrastructure provider services such as GPS. These procedures can include verifying information as to whether dynamic IP addresses are assigned, verifying firewall ports are open, checking status of nearby cellular towers, temporarily disabling Anti-Virus software during connections, restricting certain program access rights during periods of active satellite contact etc. Additionally, make use of diagnostic tools specific to boat navigation software suites such as AGNSSAnalysisOfflineExportTool.exe (from https://ps2nav.com/) which can provide some preliminary data on common errors with satellite performance and other useful security alerts. Regularly check boat navigation systems for known assets that may impact GNSS performance, such as large masses or structures within proximity or near horizon line of ship.* Finally investigate all factors which could impact satellite availability and test remedies for each potential issue until success is achieved</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the real time tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, the real time tracker is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.

This can often be caused by a number of things, but we can try to help diagnose the problem. Generally, if something is freezing or just not working correctly, it is likely due to an issue with the computer itself or the software. If you could troubleshoot and provide us with any additional information (like what browser you are using, your operating system, etc.), that would be very helpful. In the meantime, I recommend trying different browsers (like Chrome), reinstalling the software, or disabling graphics acceleration on your computer in order to see if that resolves the issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and sincerely hope that we can resolve this issue soon.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the real time tracker</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the real time tracker is resetting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury On my computer has an Enable the Real Time Tracker Application stalled.

I've tried multiple cables and different ports, but still no luck. Can somebody please help me fix this issue? It seems like a really crucial function for my boat.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Firstly, you should try reinstalling the Mercury windlock feature. There is a possibility that it may have been reset when your boat was serviced and you may need to reset it again. Second, there are other applications ( such as Alarms) that may work with your boat even if the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite does not. You could try trying different ports on the computer in order to maybe access the other software installed on it. Lastly, you should talk to your Mercury representative about the issue and see if they know whats going on. They may be able to help you figure out a solution.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>activating the vessel identification</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix activating the vessel identification is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix activating the vessel identification is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix activating the vessel identification is booting the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When I try to activate the vessel identification software in my Mercury Villager, the application will not start.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, make sure that the software is completely installed and running on your Mercury Villager.

Some potential causes could include unknown or misconfigured network settings, damaged or defective sonar hardware, incompatible software, or finite cranial bandwidth preventing reliable transmission and reception ofecho signals. (Note: In many cases, using different navigation software designed expressly for boat use can resolve these issues and help to improve overall navigation accuracy.) If you are unable to resolve the issue through troubleshooting, it is recommend that you contact Guidare Support in order to help troubleshoot and diagnose the problem.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the autopilot</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enabling the autopilot is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: enabling the autopilot is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: enabling the autopilot is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I am working on an android phone and hooked up the guide boat navigations suite. when i try to enable the autopilot, the application is erroring out every time I try. is there a way to fix that?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There can be a number of reasons why the autopilot on an Android phone might be erroring out, but one possible solution is to check whether the device has the correct permissions for the app. Make sure that it has been granted the "control AUX devices" permission, and that it is not blocked by a security application.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the fishfinder</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: enabling the fishfinder is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">One way to disable the fishfinder on an Go Pronto 9.x VHF<BR><BR> transceiver is by going into Custom Configuration and disabling the Fish<BR>  FINDERO option.

This may be one of the easiest ways to solve your problem. Another way to disable the fishfinder is by recharging the batteries, if they are low (indicator light will turn green when batteries are depleted). Once new batteries have been installed, power up the boat (engine off) and wait at least 15 seconds before rebooting to engage Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite again. That should fix the problem!</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>connecting to the internal wifi</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: connecting to the internal wifi is erroring the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Since installing the Guidare Boat Navigation Software Suite application on your computer, you have been encountering errors whenever you try to connect to the internal wifi.

One possibility is that something may be blocking the engine or propeller from properly turning. Another possibility is that something might be blocking the flow of water or gas through the engine or propeller. In either case, you'll need to take some actions to troubleshoot and solve the problem. First, try opening up the engine or propeller and cleaning any obstructions that may be preventing it from turning properly. If that doesn't work, you can take apart the propulsion system and replace any parts that are possibly broken or obstructing the flow of water or gas.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the device is stuck</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The software used on your Mercury may be causing the issue.

The IC has a pre-programmed maximum RPM limit of 1800RPM in order to protect the engine against excessive wear. If the available wind speed data indicates that the ship will not be reaching the maximum RPM limit before reaching its intended destination, the IC adjusts propulsion output to exceed the set limit in order to allow for quicker journey completion. However, when using Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite (ABAS), if there is no data from any of the wind speed sensors, then ABAS assumes that the ship is sailing at its maximum theoretical propeller RPM of 1800RPM and continues to exert outward thrust at this rate. This significantly reduces propulsion output below what is necessary to maintain forward progress and may result in a sailboat getting stuck on sandbars, inCOMPLETE circles, or even worse.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">When using Assisted Boat Assisted Software Suite (ABAS), the Mercury Instrument Cluster (IC) operates at its maximum theoretical propeller RPM of 1800RPM in order to protect the engine.

Obviously, you should try reinstalling the application from the store or your corresponding manufacturer's website if possible, but that's not always feasible or possible. From a diagnostic standpoint, trying to force close and reopen the application may also help, as well as checking task logs & service status > Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on your Mercury to determine what (if anything) went wrong during its running.

If this doesn't fix the issue, it's likely that there is something wrong with your docking alignment station or propulsion system, and you'll need to take it in for repairs.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the three camera setup</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, when I attempt to enable the three camera setup by pressing "SEARCH," the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application Freezes.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi, <BR><BR>If you are running the Mercury 2014 equipped with Autonomous Display and Co-Pilot system, then you will need to uninstall AVAS before enable the three camera setup.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the gps device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Having the gps disabled freezes the Assistante Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hello and thanks for reaching out. <BR><BR>If you are having problems with the boat assisted software suite application freezing when you enable or disable your gps, there could be a few things going on. First, it is possible that the lat/long coordinates of your boat have changed since the last time the software saw them, which would cause the application to mistakenly think that it needs to restart. Alternatively, if there is something prohibiting your wi-fi from transmitting updates to the software's GPS module, this could result in the software freezing up completely. In either case, there is a very easy workaround that should solve any problems right away. Simply disconnect your boat from Wi-Fi (if necessary) and re-connect using the wi-fi network name and password that you initially set up when configuring your boat assisted software suite application. Once reconnected, the software will resume using the latest lat/long coordinates and won't experience any future froze instances. If you continue to encounter errors with the software while disabling or enabling your gps, please reach out to our support team for further assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application will freeze and the "enable birdseye view" button on the dialog box will not work.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">This issue could result from incorrectly configured or incompatible peripheral equipment or software interfering with the interaction between your computer and the application.

One possibility is that there is too much input going on at once and the GPS device can't keep up. Try restarting the software and see if that helps. If not, you may need to reduce the load on the GPS device by disabling some of the features, like transit routing or tracking courses. Sometimes disabling these features can help alleviate interrupts in service. Finally, make sure you're physically close to the ECV terminal (within 100-500m), otherwise satellite signals can be lost and the GPS device will no longer work.visit our YouTube channel for more tips on using our software!</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When i try to enable the Birdseye view on my Mercury, it keeps resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi! <BR><BR>There could be a few things contributing to this issue, but the most common one is that you might have a corrupted file(s) in your Mercury's firmware or Access Pod software suite.

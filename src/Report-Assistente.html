One possibility is that something may be blocking the engine or propeller from properly turning. Another possibility is that something might be blocking the flow of water or gas through the engine or propeller. In either case, you'll need to take some actions to troubleshoot and solve the problem. First, try opening up the engine or propeller and cleaning any obstructions that may be preventing it from turning properly. If that doesn't work, you can take apart the propulsion system and replace any parts that are possibly broken or obstructing the flow of water or gas.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the device is stuck</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the device is stuck.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The software used on your Mercury may be causing the issue.

The IC has a pre-programmed maximum RPM limit of 1800RPM in order to protect the engine against excessive wear. If the available wind speed data indicates that the ship will not be reaching the maximum RPM limit before reaching its intended destination, the IC adjusts propulsion output to exceed the set limit in order to allow for quicker journey completion. However, when using Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite (ABAS), if there is no data from any of the wind speed sensors, then ABAS assumes that the ship is sailing at its maximum theoretical propeller RPM of 1800RPM and continues to exert outward thrust at this rate. This significantly reduces propulsion output below what is necessary to maintain forward progress and may result in a sailboat getting stuck on sandbars, inCOMPLETE circles, or even worse.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">When using Assisted Boat Assisted Software Suite (ABAS), the Mercury Instrument Cluster (IC) operates at its maximum theoretical propeller RPM of 1800RPM in order to protect the engine.

Obviously, you should try reinstalling the application from the store or your corresponding manufacturer's website if possible, but that's not always feasible or possible. From a diagnostic standpoint, trying to force close and reopen the application may also help, as well as checking task logs & service status > Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on your Mercury to determine what (if anything) went wrong during its running.

If this doesn't fix the issue, it's likely that there is something wrong with your docking alignment station or propulsion system, and you'll need to take it in for repairs.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the three camera setup</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, when I attempt to enable the three camera setup by pressing "SEARCH," the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application Freezes.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi, <BR><BR>If you are running the Mercury 2014 equipped with Autonomous Display and Co-Pilot system, then you will need to uninstall AVAS before enable the three camera setup.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the gps device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Having the gps disabled freezes the Assistante Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hello and thanks for reaching out. <BR><BR>If you are having problems with the boat assisted software suite application freezing when you enable or disable your gps, there could be a few things going on. First, it is possible that the lat/long coordinates of your boat have changed since the last time the software saw them, which would cause the application to mistakenly think that it needs to restart. Alternatively, if there is something prohibiting your wi-fi from transmitting updates to the software's GPS module, this could result in the software freezing up completely. In either case, there is a very easy workaround that should solve any problems right away. Simply disconnect your boat from Wi-Fi (if necessary) and re-connect using the wi-fi network name and password that you initially set up when configuring your boat assisted software suite application. Once reconnected, the software will resume using the latest lat/long coordinates and won't experience any future froze instances. If you continue to encounter errors with the software while disabling or enabling your gps, please reach out to our support team for further assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application will freeze and the "enable birdseye view" button on the dialog box will not work.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">This issue could result from incorrectly configured or incompatible peripheral equipment or software interfering with the interaction between your computer and the application.

One possibility is that there is too much input going on at once and the GPS device can't keep up. Try restarting the software and see if that helps. If not, you may need to reduce the load on the GPS device by disabling some of the features, like transit routing or tracking courses. Sometimes disabling these features can help alleviate interrupts in service. Finally, make sure you're physically close to the ECV terminal (within 100-500m), otherwise satellite signals can be lost and the GPS device will no longer work.visit our YouTube channel for more tips on using our software!</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the birdseye view is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When i try to enable the Birdseye view on my Mercury, it keeps resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi! <BR><BR>There could be a few things contributing to this issue, but the most common one is that you might have a corrupted file(s) in your Mercury's firmware or Access Pod software suite.

Out of all of the other features of ABC, this is the one I really need help with. When I start using ABC, there is a message that says " Camera check: n / A ". However, after scouting around on the internet, I've found several different solutions to this problem. The first option is to go into ABC's preferences and change the camera's input method. The second option is to get a new camera for my ABC. The third option is to try to fix whatever issue is preventing my camera from working.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There are a few different things that can be wrong with your camera when it comes to using ABC. One possibility is that there is a corrupt file on your camera's memorystick that needs to be repaired. Another possibility is that your camera has a firmware update that needs to be installed in order for it to work with ABC. Finally, ABC may not support the type of camera you have. In order to troubleshoot which option is most appropriate for fixing the issue, you will have to do some online searches and explore different solutions.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the birdseye view is not being displayed</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].

Regards, Catalina Gibbs.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have a 2003 mercury outback that was giving me issues over the last few months. Earlier this spring, the dashboard computer started shutting down Assisted Boat Assisted Software Suite (ABASS) at random times. I took it to a mechanic and they said it was an issue with the computer, but they weren’t able to fix it. Eventually, ABASS would always restart; however, even though it was technically working, the assistant was still disabled and wouldn’t lets me use any of the features in the navigation system. After continued frustration with this situation, I decided to look into fixing it myself.<BR><BR>To achieve my goals, I first had to disable the power conservation feature on my car. This involved accessing the car’s engine management system (EMS), which is relatively difficult for someone unfamiliar with cars and engines. Once I disabled power conservation, I was then able to branch into the ABASS computer through resetting its security code. resetting the security code allowed me direct access to all of ABASS’s files and software. From there, it was simply a matter of disabling certain modules and saving the changes before rebooting ABASS. After disabling several third-party modules, including ABASS’s automatic update functionality, I finally restored core functionality to ABASS via save/reload without requiring a security code restart. Although this process cost me time and money, ultimately I am glad that I was able to fix my Mercury's ABASS problem on my own.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>activating the assistent</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.

What can I do?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a few factors behind this issue. One possibility is that your app is not authorized on your phone's GPS sensor. To test this, first try opening the app on another device and see if the error persists. If the problem occurs on another device, then it likely has to do with permissions restrictions on your app. If the App Store does not allow you to update your app with new features or expanded functionality, then you will need to contact the developer of the app and get authorization from them before updating. If you installed the app from an untrusted source (i.e., you downloaded it from an unknown website), then there is a greater risk that malware may infect your phone and execute unwanted tasks with your device's GPS capabilities. In this situation, it would be best to take comprehensive steps to remediate your device—such as making sure all of your apps are updated and scanned for malware—before attempting to reinstall or use the offending app.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

Garmin releases new software frequently which may not support your Mercury model or navigation system. Depending on signal strength, some apps, such as BoatAssIST, require a strong satellite signal to work optimally. In order to disable the GPS device on your Mercury so that other applications can work without interference, access "Settings" by selecting the three lines in the multitouch screen then clicking on "Settings". Next, select "Satellite" and uncheck the box next to "GPS". Grant third party apps occasional access to GPS satellites when necessary by clicking on the pencil icon in the bottom left corner of their app's window.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

Thanks, Clark Graham.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I'm having difficulty repairing my boat propulsion system using the Assisted Boat Software Suite application. The problem started as heat began to slowly dissipate from my propulsion bus assembly. Subsequent inspection showed that spinning of the propellers had stopped, but the boat still appeared to be docked. Freezing of the application resulted in a complete loss of functionality. I was able to restart the application by unplugging and replugging the power cord, but the problem has since returned. Any suggestions on fixing this issue are greatly appreciated.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There are a few things you can do in order to try and fix your propulsion problem. First, make sure that anything loose is tightly secured. This could include screws, bolts, and cable ends. Second, check the insulation on all exterior wires to make sure there are no fragmentation or burns. Finally, clean the interface surfaces between the motor controller and the propeller spinners with a mild solvent such as alcohol or detergent.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the three camera setup</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

If you have an assistent activation problem, it is most likely that the reset button does not fix the issue. To eliminate the need to activate the assistant whenever you touch the gas pedal, you may need to replace your Mercury Milan Dynamic's assistent boat assisted software suite application.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.

I've tried various things to try and fix the issue, but nothing has worked yet.

Any help would be much appreciated!</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be many reasons why ABCSU is not booting. Please try the following:<BR><BR>- At a command prompt, type "bcdedit /set {bootmgr} device vgaquiet" and press enter. If this does not work, then your display adapter might not be working properly. Try to disable all other devices in bcedit and see if it helps.<BR><BR>- Have you tried to reset your computer? This might solve the problem if there was some corruption on your system drive that is causing ABCSU to not work. Please follow these instructions:<BR><BR>1. Make sure you have an emergency recovery disk available. (You can create one using this tutorial: How to Create an Emergency Recovery Disk)<BR><BR>2. Remove all external media (USB drives, CD/DVDs, etc…) You do not need them for this step.<BR><BR>3. Boot your computer from the recovery disk. If your computer does not already boot from the recovery disk, insert it into the optical drive and restart your computer. (If you are having trouble booting from the recovery disk, see the next step for instructions on how to create a bootable CD/DVD.)<BR><BR>4. Follow the instructions on the screen to selectdiskandexitinstallation(or select open for PC/Mac). This will stop Windows from installing on your main hard drive and allow you to continue with the recovery process. If you are having trouble getting to these steps, please see our blog post: How to Use a Startup Script to Automatically Start Up Your Computer From the Recovery Drive.<BR><BR>- If you have tried disabling ABCSU in BIOS but it still doesn't work, it might be because another program is using Compatibility Mode; in which case, changing Compatibility Mode might fix the issue.

First, make sure that the boatassisted software suite is properly installed and running on your computer; if not, you can find instructions online. If everything looks good and the camera is still not displaying a feed, there may be something blocking the connection between the Mercury Immer Infinite G6 and the camera. Try moving the camera closer to the display or connecting it via Bluetooth instead of using a cable. if all of these troubleshooting steps fail, there may be an issue with either the camera or the Mercury Immer Infinite G6 itself.

We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing difficulty with your boat assisted software suite and Mercury boat. We tested the product thoroughly prior to delivery and found that it should work with most boats. Here are some steps that may help:<BR><BR>1. Check to make sure the boat is tuned into the transponder signal. This can be easily accomplished by locating the boat's VHF receiver and scanning for a prominent transmissions from authorities on frequencies 121.5 or 406 MHz (depending on region).<BR><BR>2. Make sure there is enough fuel in the engine. Verify fuel levels using theNN Boat Fuel Gauge conveniently included in many of our boat software suites.

There may be a cached or provisional data folder on your computer (in Event Viewer) from the Garmin 7660 that is causing this problem. To ensure that Assistente Boat Assist shuts down as expected, try deleting this folder. Additionally, it is possible that your anti-spam measures are blocking communication between the your computer and the Garmin 7660. Double check the firewall settings whitelisted devices list and exclude any Garmin 7660s which should fix this issue.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the birdseye view</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the birdseye view is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.

Additionally, it may also be possible to disable automatic Shutdowns by adjusting the HP Automatic System Recovery Settings.

A hard drive replacement is a costly fix - usually anywhere from $200 to $1,200 depending on make and model. This isn't necessarily covered under your warranty, however it might be worth checking with the manufacturer first just to see if this is something that's covered per their policy.

In order to troubleshoot and fix the issue, we would need more detailed information about your set-up, such as which cameras you are trying to use, what devices you are linking your Mercury to, and how long your batteries have been operating. If you could isolate which camera is causing the issue and provide this information, we may be able to troubleshoot and find a solution.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the gps device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the gps device is resetting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.

There are a few possible solutions to resolving this issue. One solution could be to try restarting your computer and see if that solves the problem. Another solution could be to try disable or remove all third-party software applications from your computer and see if that resolves the issue.

To fix this problem, you need to: a) Disable the assistance's ability to sign in as an administrator. To do this, open the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Allaire\Assistente boat Aided software Suite" registry key and delete the "admin" key value. b) If you use Windows Vista or Windows 7, you also need to create a default security group for the "Allaire" application and add it to this group. c) Restart your computer.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>activating the assistent</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: activating the assistent is booting the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.

Any help would be much appreciated.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a couple potential causes for why the assistant boat assisted software suite cannot be activated at this time because it is not installed onto this computer. One possibility is that the assistant boat assisted software suite was never actually installed onto your computer in the first place- you may have downloaded it from a website or provided it to someone else, but never actually installed it on your computer. In that case, you'll need to locate the installer file and install it onto your computer. Another possible cause is that the assistant boat assisted software suite itself might be corrupted- if you've upgraded your operating system or if the files that make up the assistant boat assisted software suite are infected with a virus or malware, then activation will fail. In that situation, you'll need to uninstall the assistant boat assisted software suite and use an alternate installation method- such as putting the assistant boat assisted software suite files on a USB drive and installing them that way. If none of those solutions work, then there might be a problem with your computer's antivirus or antimalware program, in which case you'll need to contact your technician for assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked is erroring the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.

The first step is to check if the propulsion and vessel are properly connected using the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.

One possible solution is to troubleshoot and verify the connection between the propulsion and vessel.

Did you try restarting the device? If it's an iPad or iPhone, try pressing and holding down the power button for about 10 seconds until the machine turns off then back on. This should force a reset of your device and hopefully restore functionality. If that doesn't work, you may need to take your device to an Apple Store for repairs.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>i have a blank screen</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I am getting a blank screen when I try to connect to the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The diagnosis of the problem might involve several potential fixes. First, make sure that you are properly connecting to the software suite. Try wifi or wired connections. Additionally, your firewall might be blocking the traffic to or from the software suite. If you are using an organization's Intranet orextranet connection, check with your administrator for proper access credentials. Finally, if you are using a public network, be sure that the software suite is installed and working on your computer.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>there is a blinking warning led</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for there is a blinking warning led on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for there is a blinking warning led on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for there is a blinking warning led on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">There is a blinking warning led on my Assistente Boat Assist Software Suite.

To determine if this is the case, try performing a manual software reset as follows:1. Close all programs and access Internet Explorer on your computer 2. Open the "Assistente Boat Assist Software Suite" (at registrar website) 3. Click on "Help" and then on "Software Reset." On the next screen, enter your username and password and click on the "Reset" button. If the reset does not solve the blinking warning led issue, then you may need to do a complete hardware firmware update for your boat using a professional dealership service provider.<BR><BR>Please let us know if there is anything further we can help you with.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>no camera feed on the display</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for no camera feed on the display on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for no camera feed on the display on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for no camera feed on the display on my Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Assist Pacific P107 Assistive Boat Software Suite, when I try to view my camera feed on the display, none of the image or video appears.

ABS works by connecting to the motor through the internet, and then providing live guidance based on agreed speed and direction settings. However, after trying to start the engine several times, there is always a null response from the ABS software, culminating in a dead motor. This issue seems to be specific to this particular Mercury model, as other motors of different make and age have been successfully used without any issues.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble starting your motor with the ABS software. It sounds like something may not be hooked up properly. First, make sure all of the wires are pulled tight and plugged in where they should be. Second, make sure the connection between the ABS unit and the motor is good. Third, make sure that the power to the motor is turned on properly. If these three things are checked and done and the issue still persists, you may need to bring the motor in for servicing. Have a friend try to start it for you while you're away so that you can determine if it needs more brute force than just pressing buttons.

Unfortunately, this is often symptomatic of a fried Bonnie lock pin outboard electronics. Assuming you have the paid version of the boat assisted software suite, it would be advisable to first try resetting the boat assisted software suite by unplugging it from shore power and re-inserting into your Mercury. If this fails to resolve the issue, then it's possible that the electronics onboard your Mercury are fried and will need to be replaced.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>no camera feed on the display</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, no camera feed on the display.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, no camera feed on the display.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, no camera feed on the display.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">ASSISTANTE BOATS SOFTWARE SUITE:<BR>When using the product ASSISTANTE BOATS SOFTWARE SUITE on my Mercury, no camera feed on the display.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">One potential reason for this complication could be that your Mercury does not have an adequate video output connection. In order to troubleshoot this further, you might need to take certain steps to test your connection and see if the issue resolves. Once you've determined that the camera feed isn't reaching your display, there are a few things you can try to remedy the situation. One option could be to specifiy a different type of video output in the product's settings, or check with your marinerage company to see if they offer installation assistance for supplementary devices. Additionally, you could try installing a separate camera onto the boat (should your Mercury have one available) in order to observe any occurring errors on the display. If none of these methods provide a satisfactory outcome, it is likely that you will need to replace your Mercury's display or motherboard - which would then require professional assistance.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the birdseye view is not being displayed</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the birdseye view is not being displayed.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the birdseye view is not being displayed.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the birdseye view is not being displayed.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When using the product Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite on my Mercury, the birdseye view is not being displayed.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hello, <BR><BR>Thank you for reaching out to us.

To fix this problem, the Mercury must be able to override the NAM's calculations and contact a human operator for assistance when necessary. This can be achieved through the use of the Apollo Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application. When this application is activated, it takes over navigation duties from the NAM and allows crew to communicate with Operator Managers stationed onshore who can direct the ship back onto course.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">While it is possible to fix the Mercury's navigation system through the use of a custom application, this would involve the installation of a third-party software and would therefore be an extra step that could potentially disrupt the ship's systems. There are other options currently being considered by management, such as redesigning the entire navigation system or upgrading to a newer version of the NAM. In both cases, it is hoped that by fixing these issues crews will no longer have to rely on manual intervention in order to keep the ship on track.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the three camera setup</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, I am unable to enable the three camera setup.

If you are not using the latest version, please download it from our website or request an update from your manufacturer. Second, ensure that you have activated the three camera setup on your Mercury. Refer to the manual or Technical Help for more information on activating this feature. Third, if you are physically connecting your Mercury to a computer with a USB-C to USB cable, it is possible that your Mercury boot ROM is preventing the three camera setup from being enabled. To solve this issue, you may need to flash the boot ROM of your Mercury.

This is usually caused by an application deadlock in which one program keeps trying to access the same resources so the other program can't run. To fix this, try the following: 1.First check for any updated software that might be available. If there is no updated software available, then you may need to clear your computer's memory (reset) or Windows will try to initialize your computer again.  If you reset your computer and still have the problem, then you may need to uninstall the program and reinstall it from scratch.    2.Check if there are any services or programs running in the background that are crashing the birdseye view. Some common background services that can crash the birdseye view include windows updates, anti-virus software, and backup programs.  3.Close all antivirus and backup programs and windows updates that are running in the background. 4.If clearing your computer's memory does not work or if the problem persists, then you may need to disable some of the security features on your computer so that the Assistante Boat Assisted Software Suite can function properly. To do this, launch Control Panel from Start Menu → Programs → Accessories → System Tools → Security Policy.

However, after much trouble-shooting and searching our registry, we have located what seems to be the problem. The "cuore.help" website (which is used internally by the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application) apparently references a file called "CoreUserMgr.dll" which is located within the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Public\\Cuore Corporation\Cuore\Serviceability" folder on our local computer. However, due to a recent software update, this file apparently no longer exists on our machine. Consequently, when the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application attempts to access the "Cuore Corporation\Cuore\Serviceability" folder in order to activate its features, Windows 10 incorrectly believes that this is an unauthorized or misty attempt to access protected files andIt therefore shuts down the whole application abruptly.<BR><BR>To correct this issue, we will need to either reinstall the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application or find another way to manually activate its features.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: propulsion keeps spinning, but we are docked is shutting down the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Hi!

Try checking the health of your Hard Drive - this can be done by clicking on "Command Prompt" icone in the START menu, typing "cd c:", and pressing Enter. At the prompt, type "chkdsk /f". If the drive needs to be repaired, your Computer Technician will do that for you. If the health of your Hard Drive isn't the problem, then it sounds like you might have a virus or malwareinfecting your computer. Try looking for malwareremoval instructions from reputable infection- eradication sources (like About.com).

The problem principally occurs after getting Precursor Stones, which cause quicksand to form beneath the ship.  After spending an hour sinking, the player elects to leave the planet rather than wait for assistance which would require going back in time and triggering the event that created the quicksand. This leads to a freeze of the Assistante Boat Assisted Software Suite application, preventing any travel while on the planet.  One possible workaround is to repeatedly reset the application via Esc key until it startups again, but this may damage files or frustrating inconsistencies could occur if tasks are left unfinished.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enabling the three camera setup</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application? screen freezes, making it difficult to use or exit the application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The Mercury On my Mercury, how do i fix enabling the three camera setup is freezing the Assistente Boat Assisted Software Suite application? screen freezes, making it difficult to use or exit the application.

This workaround only works for the Marine Assist application; if I try to launch any other application, like Sun Odyssey's Navigation System, it won't start.

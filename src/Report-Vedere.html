This problem can occur in Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer browsers. Caused by an apparently buggy USB installation routine on Windows 10, this issue commonly occurs when using Windows' System Restore or backup/recovery features. Unfortunately there's not a simple fix on hand - restoring this particular user configuration becomes much more difficult if the device takes up any bulk storage on the computer.<BR><BR><BR>However, if you've recentrly donated a used hard drive space to the organization's Habitat for Humanity building project (previously used for video capture and record keeping), then re-using that space contains a workaround which resolves this dialog box issue. When starting up the Vedere Vessel Management Software again from scratch, just open up a remote desktop session onto one of your workstation's local USB disks, copy over all of the video files and associated files and folders onto that drive, and log out of your organisation's accounts on the software's web site and devices. Users don't need to make any modifications to their usage, as those settings will have been pulled across automatically syncing their changes with the likely duplication of dependent HBHM-provided software overwriting previous Installation Data folder settings etc etc..</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Windows 10 Cumulative Update System (MUCS) files (.CUS) contain a similar workaround for this application powerdowns.<BR><BR><BR><BR>A possible workaround for this issue is to re-use an old USB device that was previously used for video capture and record keeping.

There might be a few things that could be done to try and resolve this problem. First, it might be worth trying turning off the CCTV from within VCM. System Menu/Vedere Vessel Management Software/Preferences->Control Panel->Security and Surveillance->CCTV should have some options to disable or turn on the CCTV module. It is also possible that your Mercury's firmware might be outdated, in which case upgrading to the most recent firmware update could resolves this issue. If those two options do not work then it is possible that your Mercury's system software may be incompatible with Vedere Vessel Management Software, in which case we would recommend laptop consulting to assist with installation and configuration. ;) Hope this helps!</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the alarm</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the alarm is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the alarm is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: enable the alarm is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, my vehicle's alarm Only activates after the Vehicle launches Vedere Vessel Management Software.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Vehicle alarms are typically activated when the car is first started and after a collision.

Despite numerous attempts to turn on the engines manually (by pressing both power and Reset controls), the engines will not start; neither will the initialization sequence within Vedere Vessel Management Software. The only apparent cause seems to be that one or more of the engine control modules is malfunctured, and disabling them appears to correct the problem. Though it is easy to bypass this issue by booting into a Windows-based operating system, doing so defeats much of Mercury's special innovative functionality and could potentially lead to serious health and safety problems. There seems to be no way to fix this problem except through manual intervention.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">If you are experiencing a problem with one or more Mercury engines, your first step should be to disable the affected engines using Vedere Vessel Management Software. After disabling the engines, you can attempt to start them manually by pressing both power and Reset buttons. If the engines still will not start, your next step should be to replace the engine control modules. If you are unable to solve the problem through manual intervention or replacement of engine control modules, then your Mercury base computer may have a virus or other malware that is causing the issue. In this situation, you may need to have the Mercury base computer repaired.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>configure the software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: configure the software is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: configure the software is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: configure the software is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Your Mercury is configured to boot the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

It is possible that the software is accessing some of your removed devices in order to keep track of them, even if you've deleted them from your computer.

Additionally, if you frequently remove old devices from your computer, it might make sense to set up a separate storage area for those removable items instead of keeping them all in one place – this way, if there are problems with the software relying on stored information about removed devices, at least the impact would be localized to a specific compartment in your PC rather than sprawling out across the system as a whole.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>installing a brand new device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">2017-10-02<BR><BR>When I try to install a brand new device, the Mercury is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">You may need to reboot the Mercury server in order for the new device to be properly registered.

Check to see if any of the following are causing the problem:<BR><BR>Do you have enough memory? Mercury requires at least 4 GB of RAM to run properly. More memory will help compensate for anything that might be slowing down Mercury.<BR><BR>Does Mercury have enough disk space available? Mercury needs at least 3 GB of free disk space in order to work properly. If there isn't enough space, Mercury may not be able to create or access necessary files, which could result in problemsConfiguring the software.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>removing an old device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: removing an old device is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix: removing an old device is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix: removing an old device is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury all of a sudden, I am getting error messages when I attempt to remove an old device from the system.

Error messages typically indicate that something is wrong with the device, which may need to be replaced. If this is the case, you may want to look into getting a replacement Mercury device. If you are having trouble removing an old device from the system, it may be because the software is not functioning properly. There are various things that you may need to do in order to fix this problem. One option is to try redownloading and installing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

First, it is possible that the software is overloading, and cannot keep up with the incoming data. This could potentially be remedied by optimizing the application or by increasing the amount of memory it is using. If the software is constantly shutting down due to data overload, this may require servicing or upgrading of the underlying computer system. Alternatively, it could be the case that there is an issue with the zoom feature itself, and a repair or adjustment would be required in order to fix it.

First, it could mean that the software isn't installed properly or there's a communication issue between the software and the alarm system. If this is the case, we would recommend contacting our customer support team for further assistance. Alternatively, the alarm may be indicating that something is wrong with the vessel itself. For example, if part of the engine fails and causes the alarm to activate, then we would need to inspect and fix the engine as soon as possible in order to prevent further instrumentation problems.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>i cannot add a new device to the product</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].

It is possible that there is a problem with the Mercury's motherboard, power supply, or ventilation system. In order to determine the source of the problem, you will need to do some diagnostics. If the problem is with the Mercury's motherboard, you may need to replace the circuit board. If the problem is with the power supply, you may need to replace the power supply unit. If the problem is with the ventilation system, you may need to replace one or more fans.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the CCTV on the stern</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.

Gases from dirty air filters will cause VMS to disable one or more engines/ pneumatics because they can overpollute the cleaner lines." <BR><BR>2. Test drive your car with all doors open to allow fresh intake air into the motor. Close allwindows but ONE to help pull fumes out the car." <BR>3.

Whenever I attempt to disable the CCTV on the stern, it consistently freezes up on me and I have to restart my computer. This problem has been occurring more and more frequently and I'm starting to worry that it might be causing some sort of damage to my computer. Would you happen to know how I can solve this problem? Thank you for your time.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi there,<BR><BR>Thank you for reaching out to us about your Mercury freezing issue. We are sorry to hear that this is happening and can testify that it can be frustrating. Thank you for taking the time to fill out this survey so that we may get to the bottom of what might be causing the problem.<BR><BR>If you are experiencing continuous freezing while disabling CCTV on your stern, it could possibly be caused by a few different things. One possibility is that your computer's hardware might not be capable of handling the increasing load of the CCTV application. Another possibility is that something in your computer's settings might be causing interference with the CCTV feature. If you feel like this is a more general issue with the software rather than something specific to disabling CCTV on your stern, we would recommend revisiting your system's main settings and performance benchmarks to see if any changes can help address any problems that might be causing performance degradation or freezing altogether.<BR><BR>If disabling CCTV on your stern has consistently been causing your computer to freeze or bog down, there may not be a permanent solution available other than replacing your computer. However, some temporary Fixes may include simplifying your antivirus and firewall protection (if applicable), closing any unnecessary programs, adjusting your graphics settings if necessary, and reducing software installed onto your computer. In most cases these steps will help alleviate some latent issues from surrounding programs which may have an extended effect on threshold requirements required for system stability such as stabilising cameras or navigating vessels efficiently</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the alarm</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

Sometimes, activating or enabling the alarm service becomes problematic and needs delicate diagnosis. If the problem only occurs sometimes, it is likely that a firmware update for your alarm system may be needed. Updating the firmware on your thermostat or alarm system often resolves complicated issues like this. Unfortunately, if this fix does not work, you may need service from your thermostat or alarm company.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>adding a new device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

Regards, Raina Bonilla.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have an HP Pavillion G6 laptop that having been added a new USB key containing a RAID volume containing three hard drives. Yesterday I attempted to access the drive partitions on the USB key using "File://IS/VolumeXXX/YEARMMDD/file.ext" which has been working fine for several months. However, this morning when launching Vedere Vessel Management Software it requests that I enter the volume serial number - which I cannot find anywhere. I've tried hitting F1 to get help in the software, but nothing happens. When opening the Related Documents tab in the application, I see from diagnostic data that launch was successful - but when I drill down into the Create or Manage vessel...Result there was an error code thrown and an event Log pointing to E001030 ...which according to memory resident tool kits is associated with 'Failed trying to add device for 301'; however, after reproducing the issue and scanning for solutions online, none of them seem to address my specific problem of being unable to find the serial number on the new device. Is there anything Else I can do?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">You may need to reinstall your HP Pavilion g6 laptop's operating system.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>reset the alarms</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.

I recently had the software for the vessel management system reset by my mechanic to fix a problem. The mechanic told me that he reset the software because there was something plugged into one of the diagnostics ports and he didn't know what it was. Since then, whenever I try to configure the software, it tells me that it is resetting the application. I have tried unplugging all of the accessories, turning the car off and on again, and doing a troubleshooting scan but I can't seem to get the configuration program to work. Any ideas?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, check to make sure all of the wires are plugged in properly and making a connection. Next, connect your ignition coil wire to sparks Conn. Finally, connect 277 Volts to the Ignition Coil Wire Tips (3 prong connector). Turn on your car and allow it to run 30 seconds with the door closed while the engine is idling.

Attempting to do so results in theapplication resetting itself, preventing further deletion attempts.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be several reasons why the Mercury is having difficulty deleting an older device from the Vessel Management Software application. First, make sure that the Mercury is connected to the internet and has an active account with Vedere.com. Second, it's possible that the Mercury's firmware hasn't been updated in a while, which can sometimes cause issues with its software. Finally, it's possible that the deletion attempt was attempted while the Mercury was logged into another application (like Vedere Vessel Management Software) and Proxy Settings were enabled. In order to delete an older device from the Vessel Management Software application, disable Proxy Settings.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>installing a brand new device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.

Thank you, Jay Bryant.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I am having trouble disabling the Mercury engines when the software to control them (Vedere Vessel Management Software) starts up after I power on the vehicle.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a few things going on. One possibility is that you are trying to do something that the software was not designed to do. Another possibility is that the Mercury engine controllers (or the software that interacts with them) might not have been connecting properly when they first started up. To troubleshoot this, try following these steps:  1. Verify that all power to the vessel is off and then turn it back on. The software should start up automatically. If it does not,try turning off and then back on your computer,your network jack, and your vessels power outlet.  2. Verify that the vessel is plugged into an electrical outlet and see whether any lights come on when you turn on your computer or when you plug in the USB port (port 6).If there are no lights coming on and you have verified that all power is off to the vessel, then you likely have a wiring problem somewhere in your chain of command. In this case, you would need to send an electrician out to diagnose the problem and fix it.  3. Verify that both Mercury engines are turned off by unplugging them from their controller and checking the voltages (mpu voltage converter can be cumbersome to access). When both engines are OFF,the numbers should be within 0.6v-1v of each other (measured between adjacent connections on the mpu circuit boards; ±5%), so malfunctioning amplifier stages or electronic vice-grip levers in one engine could make the voltage jump around quite a bit even though both engines are completely removed from their controllers. 4. Use a reset button (provided with some controllers) which briefly reapplies power to associated devices like radios and sensors for diagnostic purposes; holding down this button for more than 50 ms makes sure ot specifically contacts all associated components internally mounted on offerors during operation 5. Turn each engine ON slowly (and note how long run time each lasts), letting go once running smoothly</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>configure the software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.

Again, our customer service team would be more than happy to help support you in this process. <BR>We hope that this helps and please do not hesitate to reach out if you encounter any further difficulties.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>configure the software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.

It sounds like you might be experiencing an issue with your alarms resetting on your Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

Some common issues they might face while installing a new device include dried out cable connections, conflicts with older software products, and corrupted files. Ultimately, it leads to installation errors. Depending on the severity of the issue, installing a NEW device might not be the solution. In some cases, our technicians may need to restore or reset your devices in order to resolve your problem. Further technical guidance would be needed for this specific scenario.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the fire fighting mode</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.

First, make sure that your computer is duly updated and has all the latest security patches installed. Second, make sure that your hard drive is clean and free of any large files or unnecessary programs. Third, try re-loading the program by restarting your computer and running it from the installation disk again. If all of these solutions fail, it might be necessary to take your software off-line for an extended period of time in order to fix its problems.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>how to remove an existing device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for how to remove an existing device on my Vedere Vessel Management Software.

Can you help?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">First, it's important to understand that resetting the software might not actually repair the issue. A more complex issue might need a professional technician to resolve. In terms of resolutions, changing video resolutions can often help if the issue is with graphics or icons. Simply adjusting the resolution may free up the screen and allow you to navigation content. Pulling the power cord may work in some cases, but it's not always a definitive fix. If resetting or changing resolutions don't work, check to ensure there are no hidden obstructions blocking the conning display from receiving power. If these don't solve the issue, it may be necessary to have the vessel management software serviced by a professional technician.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>the device is stuck</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Vedere Vessel Management Software on my Mercury, the device is stuck.

This means that the alarm boundaries are set by landmarks on the equipment. However, sometimes you may want to change the alarm boundaries. There are a few ways to do this.<BR><BR>One way to change the boundaries is to adjust the charts on the TomTomsoftware that controls the alarm. This can be accessed through the "Alarm editor" part of Vedere Vessel Management Studio on your computer. Navigate to "Chart Extremes .... => File Path Setting correspondance" and make the necessary changes to the charts. After making the changes, save your changes and re-launch Vedere Vessel Management Software. The new boundaries will be in effect from now on when you detect an incident.<BR><BR>Another method is to use the Feature Star Buddy feature in Vedere Vessel Management Software. With this feature, you can snap star points anywhere around your equipment and automatically establish new alarm boundaries ascharted stars fall within those bounds. You'll need to create a map before you start using Feature Star Buddy, and then Save it once it's done so you don't have to reenter all of your information each time you want to use it. To access Mode Feature Star Buddy, go to "Features" => Mariners Systemmanagement => Advisories => Feature Star Buddy and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">.<BR><BR>(Note: The Feature App may allow you toto manually set boundaries as long, but it is not adapted for this purpose and also has some limitations. For example, it cannot take into account the type of vessel or wind conditions.)</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>how to reset the software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>When using the product [PRODUCT] on my [BOAT], [KEYWORD].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: When using the product Vedere Vessel Management Software on my Mercury, how to reset the software.

I've found numerous online posts about people having had this same issue with their Mercurys, but no definitive solutions.

Can someone provide help/advice on how to permanently fix this problem?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">The issue with your Mercury is most likely caused by one or more electromechanical failures in the power distribution and control circuitry. These failures can manifest as intermittent failures of critical engines or other critical systems, usually within a short period of time after startup. As unlikely as it may seem, an electromechanical failure could occur at any point in the power distribution circuitry, including in relays,circuit breakers, wall Units, fuse pockets, surge suppressors,and other components. Finding and correcting the cause of this failure will generally require a detailed examination of all circuit boards to locate and correct deficiencies. Once the problem has been resolved, you may need to repeatedoccasionally to keep components from reconditioning themselves over time due to electrostaticdischarge buildup.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>configure the software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: configure the software is freezing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

There are a few things that you can try to troubleshoot and fix this issue:<BR><BR>1. Make sure that you are solely relying on the dedicated device for viewing and managing vessels - if you are also using other applications, there is a greater potential for conflict and resetting of the software.<BR><BR>2. Check the connection between your device and Vedere Vessel Management Software - if there is a frequent loss or interruption of connection, it could be causing the issue. Try configuring the network connectivity settings on both devices to see if that resolves the issue.<BR><BR>3. Check to see if any updates have been released for Vedere Vessel Management Software in recent weeks - missing important updates could lead to conflicts and resetting of the software.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the fire fighting mode</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the fire fighting mode is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

Can you please help?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a couple of reasons why the alarm isn't going off when you first start up the application. One possibility is that you may have disabled the alarm in the software. There are several ways to disable the alarm, see our troubleshooting tips for more information. If disabling the alarm didn't work, then the issue might be with the electronics in your car. You can try resetting your car's broken or disconnected battery, or by checking if there's a power outage in your area and restoring power to your car. If neither of those alternatives work, then you may need to enter car description into our support form and our team will do their best to help you out.

And the reset button doesn't work, even when I press it for a long time. What do I do?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There can be a number of reasons why your router's alarms will not reset. Some possible causes include: the router may be stuck in a bootloader or hard-reset state; incorrect button pressed during reset process; incompatible flash drive inserted into router when performing reset; configuration errors within the firmware that have not been fixed; corrupted NVRAM directory on the router. <BR><BR>Assuming that the problem is with the router's firmware (rather than configuration or user input), one approach to resetting the alarm is to power down the device and use either a computer or external re-envisionable Resetter tool (available online) to reboot it into its "default" or factory state. Firmware updates may also provide fixes for certain issues, so it is worth checking for firmware updates if your alarms are not functioning as they should. Additionally, please note that router passwords are typically not recoverable once they've been forgotten, so it is important to save any relevant deployment instructions and other critical information such as network card and flash drive informatin in an easily accessible location in case you need to revert back to an earlier configuration.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>zooming to a different screen</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: zooming to a different screen is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

Specifically, when we install or update any new device- such as a new motherboard or cpu- the equipment inevitably bogs down the machine's startup sequence, preventing us from launching the Vedere Vessel Management Software (VMS) application installed on it. To make matters worse, after stumbling over several online tutorials that only served to confuse and complicate matters further, we've come across several contradictory methods and advice. In frustration, we've just about given up on trying to fix this pesky issue when Rocky Burnett came up with a possible solution.<BR><BR><BR><BR>In our case, replacing the old motherboard with a newer model seems to have temporarily fixed the issue; however, since upgrading our cpu likewise seems to trigger the problem whenever we attempt to start VMS, there's no telling exactly what needs to be done in order to correct this indifferent occurrence. Regardless, preserving all our original hardware documentation in case something goes wrong down the road is definitely worthwhile.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the fire fighting mode</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: enable the fire fighting mode is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

One possible cause would be if there is something blocking the signal input to your computer's conning display. This can be caused by debris or moisture on the conning display screen or in the vicinity of your computer. Other potential causes for the problem could include a faulty conning display graphics card, a malfunctioning driver, or a damaged wiring connection. If you are experiencing other problems with your computer, such asbrowser crashses, system freezes, or printing issues, it might be worth trying to reinstall the Vessel Management Software or to update your drivers. If neither of those solutions resolves the issue, you can seek help from your Computer Service Technician.<BR></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the CCTV on the stern</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix: [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix: disable the CCTV on the stern is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.

Second, make sure that your HDMI cable is properly plugged into the port on your computer and into the HDMI port on your Vessel; if it's not plugged in securely, ambient energy from nearby devices like microwaves can cause viruses or other hardware problems on your hardware, which can prevent your Vessel from loading properly. Finally, if you've tried the tips listed above and your device is still stuck onscreen, please reach out to our customer support team for help.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>i have a blank screen</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>I need a fix for [KEYWORD] on my [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT].</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Vedere Vessel Management Software.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Vedere Vessel Management Software.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">I need a fix for i have a blank screen on my Vedere Vessel Management Software.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">I have a blank screen on my Vedere Vessel Management Software.

Any help would be much appreciated!</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">There could be a few potential problems with your Merc software. One possibility is that you may have accidentally clicked on something that inadvertently killed the running of the software. If this is the case, please try turning off all of your computer'sapps, rebooting your computer, and then starting up again manually by choosing "Merc Software" from the Startoption menu. If that doesn't work, possibly neccessary is to call customer service.<BR><BR>Another problem could be a rogue software component. When you first get a new piece of software, there are usually a few things that need to be configured (setting up passwords and user accounts, for example). Some plug-ins or components of the program may not function as they should if they were added at a later date by another user - this can cause the software to suddenly quit working in some circumstances. In order to determine if this is the case, try restarting your Merc software completely (not just closing it down and restarting it), looking through all of your personal settings (including any passwords), and trying to recreate any accidental configurations you may have made. If that fails to solve the problem, then it might be necessary to call customer service.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>removing an old device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix removing an old device is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix removing an old device is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix removing an old device is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury device removal helpline tells participants to remove their old device and replace it with a new one, which shuts down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Managing devices and software can be complicated and time-consuming.

One problem can be seen when adding a new device to the network. When the new device is added, Mercury sends a signal to the device asking it to "update its cache." However, this signal can freeze the Vedere Vessel Management Software application which prompted Microsoft support to recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the software.

A better solution would be for Mercury On Demand to use Creeper or an automation utility to add new devices without sending a signal or interfering with Windows settings. This way, users would not have to worry about individual sets of customized settings getting lost due to software updates.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>reset the alarms</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is freezing the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is freezing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is freezing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is freezing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, how do I fix reset the alarms is freezing the Vedere Vessel Management Software application?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Cannot reset the alarms.

There are a few things that could trigger an inconsistency between the settings on the Vessel Management Software application and the values stored in Vedere Control Panel: 1) if settings (position, heading, speed, etc…) were changed directly on the Vessel Management Software application, but not saved in Vedere Control Panel; 2) if adjustments were made to settings that were automatically exported from Vedere Control Panel to the Vessel Management Software application, but not vice versa; or 3) if incorrect navigational database files have been uploaded to the Vessel Management Software application. Attempting to solve this problem by restoring defaults on the Vessel Management Software application and Vedere Control Panel might resolve the inconsistency issue, but it is also possible that user-generated data may be lost in this process. In this case, it may be necessary to recreate all of the vessel's historical data from scratch using either manual input or exporting historical records from Vedere Control Panel and importing them into the Vessel Management Software application.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>removing an old device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: removing an old device is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: removing an old device is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: removing an old device is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Vedere Vessel Management Software application has stopped working correctly because an old device has been removed.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Hi, <BR><BR>Thank you for contacting us about the Vedere Vessel management software.

Additionally, disabling the CCTV may lead to other safety issues, such as theft or vandalism. Consequently, it may be best to leave the CCTV enabled unless there is a specific reason to disable it.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the alarm</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is erroring the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is erroring the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When I try to enable the alarm my Mercury Odometer begins showing a 0 as the mileage rather than the actual numbers.

I'm not sure what else could be causing this issue, but I need help fixing it.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Essentially one potential issue could be that you updated your graphics card drivers after experiencing problems. If your computer was previously stable with graphics card drivers and now the conning display is not working correctly, then it's likely something changed with those new drivers that caused this problem. Checking to make sure all other programs are closed before you enable the conning display is another simple way to try and pinpoint the cause. Once you have determined the source of the issue, fixing it will require further research or troubleshooting.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>disable the CCTV on the stern</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix disable the CCTV on the stern is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix disable the CCTV on the stern is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix disable the CCTV on the stern is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">When you turn on the CCTV on the stern of your Mercury, it is disabling the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing difficulties with the Vedere Vessel Management Software application, particularly as this appears to be impacting camera functionality.

Firstly, is ensuring all devices are registered with the Management Software application? If not, the application may not recognise any new devices when they are added. Secondly, if adding a new device resulted in the Management Software application shutting down, there may be an issue with the device or connectivity. Thirdly, it is possible that periodic updates or security patches have been installed which the current version of the Management Software Application cannot accommodate. Fourthly, versions of Mercury older than 18.1 (the most recent release at time of writing) may not support adding certain devices, such as cellular equipment or fish trackers. It may be necessary to upgrade to a newer release in order to add these devices. Fifthly, please check that there are no firewall issues blocking the device from communicating with the Vessel's systems. Sixthly, please whitelist the vessel IP address in any routers used by the Vessel so that all devices connected directly thereto can access Vessel systems properly.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>reset the alarms</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is shutting down the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is shutting down the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">Vedere Vessel Management Software on Mercury shuts down and fails to reset alarms when a Vessel closes its corresponding Portal using the Quit Vessel button.

The exact course of action required depends on your specific boat model and configuration, but typically involves diagnostic and repair procedures specific to yourboat.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment"></p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the alarm</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is resetting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the alarm is resetting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury vehicle management software application will reset when you enable the alarm.

Under the WARNINGS tab in the Property panel, select ALARMS from the listbox. b. Click on the DISMISS ALARM button to erase the alarm condition at that particular location. Once you've clicked on that button, an LAPD message should appear to inform you that "your alarm has been erased."

I replaced the speedometer on my car with a Bosch aftermarket unit and ever since then I have been having trouble installing new devices. The first time it happened I replaced my disk drive and everything went fine, however after that I have had to reset the vessel management software application on my Mercury multiple times. Whenever I try to install a new device the software detects that there is already a device installed and it prompts me to initialize or replace the device. Since I did not voluntarily replace my old device with a new one the software thinks there has been a malfunction and therefore repeatedly asks me to reset it. Now, every time I try to install new device or update an existing one on my Mercury all I get are error messages and eventually the software will force close altogether which prevents me from doing any sort of work on my car. Can somebody please help me figure out how to fix this?</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Hello,  I have had the same problem as you. My car would not let me install a new device it said there was an installing the device already which happened because I replaced my speedometer with a Bosch after market unit. After doing some research I found out that when you are trying to install a new device or update an existing one on your mercury all you get is"error message and eventually the software will force close altogether which prevents me from doing any sort of work on my car." To fix this you need to initialize your smart phone or erase the registry. Both of these can be done by following these steps:\015\012 1. Turn off your Mercury 2. Restart with the drivers' installation disc 3.When asked for CD press 3 4. From "Set up your Car" highlight "System > Initialize Vehicle Parameters." 5. Select Initialize 6. Follow screens 7. When prompted to Erase Flash Logo Advise "Yes" 8.

Unfortunately, we can't do anything to help you fix the installation issue on your end - that falls under the control of your computer's operating system. However, there are some things you can do in order to try and resolve the ongoing crashing and freezing issues you're experiencing with Vedere Vessel Management Software.<BR><BR>First, make sure that the devices attached to your ASA are plugged into the power source and properly configured with their driver software. If the devices are recognized and are properly configured, then there's a good chance that something else is causing the installation problems on your system. The first thing you can try is restarting your computer - if crashes or freezes become less frequent after restarting your computer, then that could be a sign that something smaller is causing the issue and can be fixed without requiring a full system reboot. You can also upgrade your computer's operating system version to see if that resolves any installation or crash issues. Finally, if upgrading your OS does not resolve problems, it might be necessary to contact Viet Tan Technologies Support for assistance troubleshooting the specific type of installation issue you're having.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>reset the alarms</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The reset alarm function on the Mercury CERES data storage server appears to have stopped working.

In some cases, third-party software that can uninstall older DVD players or upgrade their firmware may be available. In others, it may be necessary to remove the DRM encryption from the player in order to install a newer version. If your car 'won't restart' due to the need to remove a newer DVD player from the system, it may be worth reaching out to a dealership or mechanic for support.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>installing a brand new device</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix installing a brand new device is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Mercury refuses to install the latest device software because it claims the installation will overwrite an existing copy of the software.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Assuming there is an existing copy of the device software, you should reinstall the software using the provided installation media.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>enable the fire fighting mode</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>On my [BOAT], how do i fix [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the fire fighting mode is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the fire fighting mode is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">On my Mercury, how do i fix enable the fire fighting mode is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">On my Mercury, when I try to enable the fire fighting mode, the application boot errors out.

There are several potential causes for this problem and depending on the specific situation, one or more of the below solutions may be applicable:<BR><BR>1) Missing dependencies: verify that all required dependencies for VVMS are present on the system and that they are installed in the correct order. If any of the required dependencies is missing, VVMS will not start up.<BR><BR>2) Corruption of the VVMS configuration file: if the VVMS configuration file is corrupted, it will not be possible to start VVMS. To verify if this is the case, try accessing the VVMS administrator interface from another user account and see if it loads correctly. If it does not, there is a high probability that the configuration file is corrupted and you will need to restore it from a backup.<BR><BR>3) Incorrect user permissions: if a user does not have rights to access and use VVMS, it will not be possible to start up VVMS when a new device is added. Check the user accounts in Active Directory for any users who lack permissions to administer devices in Active Directory and change their permissions accordingly.<BR><BR>4) Device drivers not loaded: if appropriate device drivers are not installed on the system, they will not be able to talk to the new device and VVMS will not start up. Verify that all required device drivers are installed on the system and locate them in properly registered directories. If they are not located properly, you may need to get them from a third-party source or install them using an administrative software installation tool such as WindowsInstaller 3.1.<BR><BR>5) Incorrectly configured removable storage media: if removable storage media that contains data crucial for running VVMS cannot be accessed either because it is missing or has been removed from the system completely, then VVMS will not start up. Try reinstalling the operating system if necessary to repair or replace the removable storage media.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">Alternatively, you can move the data necessary for VVMS to a network location.<BR><BR>6) Corrupted files in a device: if a device is corrupt and infected with a virus, it will not be possible to access files on the device and VVMS will not start up. If the device is physically damaged, part of the filesystem may be severely corrupted and this will also prevent VVMS from starting up. In situations like these, it may be necessary to reformat the entire disk drive.<BR><BR>7) invalid configuration file settings: if some settings in the VVMS configuration file are invalid, this will prevent VVMS from starting up. Check the entry for "device type" in the config file to make sure that the correct device driver has been selected and that the correct path to the driver file has been specified.<BR><BR>8) Insufficient memory: if the system is running low on memory, VVMS may not start up even if all of its requisite requirements are present. Check system resources closely to see whether any additional resources (such as more RAM or faster processors) may be required to support VVMS.</p><HR><h2>createCase</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td>reset the alarms</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Title Sentence:</td><td>How do i fix: [KEYWORD] is booting the [PRODUCT] application.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Sentence:</td><td>Create a description for this problem: [TITLE] for the product [PRODUCT]. </td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms Sentence:</td><td>Create a detailed problem description for: How do i fix: reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h2>createCaseComment</h2><table><tr><td>Product:</td><td>Vedere Vessel Management Software</td></tr><tr><td>Boat:</td><td>Mercury</td></tr><tr><td>Version:</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Temp:</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Length:</td><td>500</td></tr></table><hr><h1>How do i fix: reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</h1><h4>For model: Mercury</h4><p class="version">Installed version: 1</p><h3>Problem</h3><p class="problem">How do i fix: reset the alarms is booting the Vedere Vessel Management Software application.</p><hr><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="symptoms">The Vedere Vessel Management Software application is sporadically crashing when trying to reset the alarms shortly after startup.</p><h3>Comment</h3><p class="comment">As long as the alarm reset cycles are short (<2 minutes) and you have latest software, there is no noticeable issue.

If either of these possibilities are causing the problem, there are some quick fixes that can hopefully resolve the issue. One possible fix involved getting in contact with Mercury customer service and having them register the device for the software. There may also be a solution available that does not involve contacting Mercury customer service.
